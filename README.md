In this project the area of Machine Learning was applied to Formula One race strategy, to assess just how applicable ML and AI are in Formula One. With the vast amounts of data gathered by Formula One teams during each race, and the availability of high-performance computing, Formula One is ripe for the application of AI and ML. There are a great number of areas in Formula One that could benefit from the application of ML and AI, but race strategy was chosen to be the area of focus for this project. Race strategy was chosen due to some recent high-profile mistakes by some Formula One teams and the availability of suitable public data for model training.
For all the complexities of Formula One race strategy, the problem faced by an F1 strategist is a simple question: “When do I call my drivers in for a pitstop?”. The decision-making behind this question involves simulations, data analysis and human intellect. Having contacted several F1 engineers, it was confirmed that ML and AI tools are currently not part of this decision-making toolbox, and with this, the premise of this project was born. 
A Machine Learning model was successfully built which produced a probability of a given driver pitting for each lap of the race. The model was trained, evaluated and tested using race data from 2018 to 2023. On separate test data, the model displayed an ability to identify various common race situations and provide a probabilistic output which would be useful for a Formula One strategist to use as part of their decision-making toolbox.
In this report the background theory of the model will be explained, the methodology for developing it, and the model’s performance, will be discussed. As part of analysing the model's results, the model’s performance for several races will be presented, in the same way that a Formula One strategist would use the model. Finally, as part of the conclusion some thoughts will be given on the usefulness of the model developed and future work that could be done to improve the model.
